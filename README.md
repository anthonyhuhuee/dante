Epitech group (duo) project to do a maze generator & solver.
I did the generator, my mate the solver.

## Screenshots

On the screen it is a 15 x 15 map, generated & solved. You can try it with bigger maps.

## ðŸ›  Skills
C - Algorithm

## Lessons Learned

How to check valgrind (memory leak), and how to optimise my algorithm.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:anthonyardhuin/dante.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd dante
```

Compile the project

```bash
  make
```

Start the algorithm

```bash
  ./generator/generator "SIZE" "SIZE"
  or
  ./solver/solver "FILE_TO_SOLVER"
```

How to use generator map in solver ?

```bash
  ./generator/generator "SIZE" "SIZE" > "NAME_OF_FILE"
  or
  ./solver/solver "NAME_OF_FILE"
```


## FAQ

#### What is the goal ?

Create a simple thing, which is a maze, and optimise the program to do it quickly.
(15 x 15 is not the same time spent as a 500 x 500).

#### What is each character ?

'X' is a Wall
'*' is an Empty place
'o' is the best way to the end
